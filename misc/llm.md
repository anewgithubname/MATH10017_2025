# AI-assisted Programming Tools (such as ChatGPT)

[The use of AI is prohibited in assessments](https://www.bristol.ac.uk/bilt/sharing-practice/guides/guidance-on-ai/using-ai-in-assessment/#:~:text=Categories%20of%20generative%20AI%20use%20in%20assessment,-In%20this%20section&text=Category%202:%20Minimal%20%E2%80%93%20for%20example,student-facing%20academic%20integrity%20pages.). You should not use it for writing code, not even using it to correct typos or writing comments, when working on assessments. 

Toward the end of 2022, the Large Language Models chat bots (such as ChatGPT) has demonstrated its capability of generating code. I hope that you can use this technology to enrich your leaning experiences. However, there are also concerns about plagiarism and cheating. 

- Including AI-generated code in your submission is regarded as cheating in this course. 

- You can ask AI to assist your learning. For example, you can ask AI, why my code gives me XYZ error? However, you should not ask AI to write XYZ code for you. You should fix it yourself. 

In your exam, you will not have access to any AI tools, as you will write code on the paper.
